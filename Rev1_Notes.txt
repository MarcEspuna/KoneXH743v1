- Fix issue with LEDs and barometer on Top layer. 
	-	Remove top barometer. 

- Fix footprint of 4R7 inductor
- Maybe look at polygon pour again, remove ground pour where unneeded. 
- Restyle pads, maybe add silk screen, remove unnecessary silk, maybe fix pad numbering on MOSFETs

-----------------
IMUs
Fix vias on plane edges.

Investigate PI filter on IMU. Maybe remove it and add high freq capacitors instead. No internal filtered trace.
Look into resistors of SPRacing on IMUs
Expand traces where it can be.
Remove TX pad, roam for IMU traces

------------------
MAIN NOISE ISSUE!
Move pads under ESC connector to top layer.
Improve 9V regulator layout.
Add bigger output capacitor and input as well
Maybe even add a pi filter on the 9V output...
------------------
ELRs
Think about the wifi thingy
How to flash the device as well. Maybe a pullup on the enable pin on the ELRs regulator? 

------------------
Rework pads shapes and sizes. 
Button holes to NC.
Add one 5V to 5VREG and the other one USB powered.
